## Pre-composing mcd_transformers transformerExporter.go file for building plugin in Dockerfile
Anytime a change is made in mcd_transformers which necessitates changes to the mcd_transformers `transformerExporter.go` plugin file,
we need to cut a new release with the new pre-composed `transformerExporter.go` file in the
`mcd_transformers/plugins` directory.

To do so, we can use vulcanizedb's `compose` command with the `exporter.save` flag in the provided config file (e.g. docker.toml)
set to `true`. This tells the `compose` command to write the `transformerExporter.go` to the `vulcanizedb/plugins` directory
(in addition to the `transformerExporter.so` file). We can then copy the `transformerExporter.go` file over to `mcd_transformers/plugins`
and ignore the output .so file. 

```
./vulcanizedb compose --config=$GOPATH/src/github.com/vulcanize/mcd_transformers/environments/docker.toml
cp plugins/transformerExporter.go $GOPATH/src/github.com/vulcanize/mcd_transformers/plugins
```

Only if any of the autogenerated code in the `transformerExporter.go` file itself needs to change does the file need to be regenerated.
The transformers that are imported as part of that file, and their internal packages (e.g. converters/repositories) can
change without updates to the transformerExporter.go file as long as the import path and name of the transformer initializers
doesn't need to be updated in the `transformerExporter.go` file. If a transformer needs to be added or removed,
that would also necessitate updates to the .go file. The internal details of the imported transformers are set by the context
used to build the .so file.
